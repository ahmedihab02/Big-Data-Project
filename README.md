This project focuses on crime prediction using the NYPD (New York City Police Department) complaint data. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the offense type based on user inputs such as borough and offense code. By leveraging PySpark, scikit-learn, and other data processing and machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into crime patterns and enable interactive crime predictions.

The problem statement revolves around understanding and predicting crime patterns in New York City. By analyzing historical complaint data, we aim to identify trends, correlations, and patterns that can help predict the type of offense given specific inputs. This information can be valuable for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers to allocate resources effectively and improve public safety measures.

The primary data source for this project is the NYPD complaint data, obtained from a CSV file. This dataset contains information about various attributes such as the offense description, borough, date, and time of occurrence. It provides a rich collection of data points that can be analyzed to uncover insights and build a predictive model.


The technologies utilized in this project include PySpark, a distributed data processing framework, and scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library. PySpark offers scalability and efficient processing capabilities for handling large datasets, while scikit-learn provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
The expected outcomes of this project include:
1.	Data preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
2.	Exploratory data analysis: Extracting insights from the data through statistical analysis and data visualization techniques.
3.	Machine learning model development: Building a random forest classifier to predict the offense type based on borough and offense code inputs.
4.	Model evaluation: Assessing the accuracy of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5.	Interactive crime prediction: Allowing users to input borough and offense code values to obtain predictions about the offense type.
6.	Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation to guide users through the code and facilitate a better understanding of the project.

By successfully accomplishing these outcomes, this project aims to contribute to the field of crime analysis and prediction, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to ensure public safety.
